    <h1>ðŸ”‘ General Strategy</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Know your code inside-out.</li>
        <li>Be able to explain every line and why you wrote it.</li>
        <li>Understand models, routes, database relations (backref, lazy, keys, etc.).</li>
        <li>Be ready to modify or add functionality on the spot.</li>
        <li>Prepare both backend (logic, APIs, DBMS, Flask, security) and some frontend (basic CSS, UI tweaks).</li>
        <li>Prepare theory & common topics.</li>
        <li>Study class inheritance, OOP in Python, security features, REST APIs, MVC pattern.</li>
        <li>Be thorough with DBMS concepts (models, relationships, controllers).</li>
        <li>Learn CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).</li>
        <li>Review previous year / sheet questions â€” most questions are repeated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Project explanation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Start with a clear, structured demo (models, routes, database, roles, functionalities).</li>
        <li>Show why you chose specific implementations.</li>
        <li>Keep a list of all implemented features so you don't forget to present them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ðŸŽ¯ During the Viva</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stay calm and confident â€” proctors are usually chill, polite, and helpful.</li>
        <li>Don't over-explain or bluff; if you don't know, admit it honestly. Many examiners will guide you.</li>
        <li>Answer to the point; avoid unnecessary details.</li>
        <li>Expect rapid-fire style questions, especially theory â€” they often repeat from the sheet.</li>
        <li>Proctors may ask you to implement small changes (e.g., background color change, password hashing, CSS tweak). Practice such edits beforehand.</li>
        <li>Some examiners focus more on project/code than theory, so be ready for both.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ðŸ“Œ Practical Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Join the meet early; keep everything ready (ID card, GitHub repo, project portal, credentials).</li>
        <li>Avoid wasting time searching for files/commands â€” have a reference notepad ready.</li>
        <li>Practice installing and running your project quickly from scratch (download, venv setup, runserver).</li>
        <li>Be polite, greet your proctor, and ask for feedback at the end.</li>
        <li>If asked about using AI tools, be honest â€” some proctors specifically watch for misuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>âœ… Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Know your code like your child (implementation, logic, libraries, DB).</li>
        <li>Revise the Google Sheet questions â€” 80â€“90% are repeated.</li>
        <li>Prepare core theory concepts (OOP, DBMS, Flask, APIs, Security).</li>
        <li>Be confident, calm, and honest â€” proctors are usually supportive.</li>
        <li>Practice quick code changes & demo flow.</li>
    </ol>
