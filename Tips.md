# ðŸ”‘ General Strategy

- Know your code inside-out.
- Be able to explain every line and why you wrote it.
- Understand models, routes, database relations (backref, lazy, keys, etc.).
- Be ready to modify or add functionality on the spot.
- Prepare both backend (logic, APIs, DBMS, Flask, security) and some frontend (basic CSS, UI tweaks).
- Prepare theory & common topics.
- Study class inheritance, OOP in Python, security features, REST APIs, MVC pattern.
- Be thorough with DBMS concepts (models, relationships, controllers).
- Learn CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Review previous year / sheet questions â€” most questions are repeated.

Project explanation
- Start with a clear, structured demo (models, routes, database, roles, functionalities).
- Show why you chose specific implementations.
- Keep a list of all implemented features so you donâ€™t forget to present them.

## ðŸŽ¯ During the Viva

- Stay calm and confident â€” proctors are usually chill, polite, and helpful.
- Donâ€™t over-explain or bluff; if you donâ€™t know, admit it honestly. Many examiners will guide you.
- Answer to the point; avoid unnecessary details.
- Expect rapid-fire style questions, especially theory â€” they often repeat from the sheet.
- Proctors may ask you to implement small changes (e.g., background color change, password hashing, CSS tweak). Practice such edits beforehand.
- Some examiners focus more on project/code than theory, so be ready for both.

## ðŸ“Œ Practical Tips

- Join the meet early; keep everything ready (ID card, GitHub repo, project portal, credentials).
- Avoid wasting time searching for files/commands â€” have a reference notepad ready.
- Practice installing and running your project quickly from scratch (download, venv setup, runserver).
- Be polite, greet your proctor, and ask for feedback at the end.
- If asked about using AI tools, be honest â€” some proctors specifically watch for misuse.

## âœ… Conclusion

1. Know your code like your child (implementation, logic, libraries, DB).
2. Revise the Google Sheet questions â€” 80â€“90% are repeated.
3. Prepare core theory concepts (OOP, DBMS, Flask, APIs, Security).
4. Be confident, calm, and honest â€” proctors are usually supportive.
5. Practice quick code changes & demo flow.
